     * 'ready' is used to signify that this query has loaded its initial state and is up-to-date with its corresponding

     * 'key_entered' fires when a key enters this query. This can happen when a key moves from a location outside of
     * this query to one inside of it or when a key is written to GeoFirestore for the first time and it falls within
     * this query.
     *
     * 'key_exited' fires when a key moves from a location inside of this query to one outside of it. If the key was
     * entirely removed from GeoFire, both the location and distance passed to the callback will be null.
     *
     * 'key_moved' fires when a key which is already in this query moves to another location inside of it.

     * 'key_modified' fires when a key which is already in this query and the document has changed, while the location has stayed the same.
